# EchoCert

EchoCert is a deterministic audit and receipt engine for large language model (LLM) outputs.

It records AI responses as static artifacts, generates tamper-evident hashes, and produces verifiable receipts that expose output drift, silent changes, and behavioral deltas over time.

EchoCert does not evaluate truth, intent, alignment, or model internals.
It produces evidence, not judgments.

## What EchoCert Is
- A forensic audit layer for AI outputs
- A black-box flight recorder for LLM behavior
- A reproducible, inspectable, deterministic system

## What EchoCert Is Not
- Not a model evaluator
- Not a safety classifier
- Not a compliance authority
- Not a live agent or prompt modifier

EchoCert is designed to support governance, compliance, research, and accountability workflows.
